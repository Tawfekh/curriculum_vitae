# Summary

I am a statistical geneticist and data scientist at [RAGT2N](https://www.ragt.fr/). I have 4+ years of broad-based experience in building machine learning models using large datasets of omic data (genomic, proteomic transcriptomic etc).

I am proficient in predictive modeling, data processing, and data mining algorithms, as well as scripting languages, including R, C++, Bash and Python.

My Mission :
- follow new developments in statistics and machine learning applied to plant
breeding;
- manage and analyze large scale data, develop innovative machine learning
approaches, processes and pipelines;
- collaborate internally with multi-disciplinary teams to ensure appropriate
experimental designs, statistical methods and interpretations are implemented;
- work closely with other team members to determine the analytical tools
needed to perform statistical analyses;
- play a key role in the development of applications that enable plant breeders
and scientists to design and analyze breeding experiments;
- develop user manuals and technical documentations and training for endusers
of the applications",
    "Scientific Researcher", "GA2 unit/ INRAE of Orleans", "02/2019 - 06/2022","The main objective of was to improve genome-wide based phenotype predictions
model in an economically important species (poplar) by integrating contextual
information from the underlying genetic system inferred from 'omics' data, in
particular through the inference of gene networks. We wanted to add explanatory
power to our predicting models, without losing the predictive quality required for
the operational breeding in poplar.
My Mission :
- Processing the raw data;
- Constitution of a state of the art of the existing methodology dedicated to the
inference of gene networks and their use in genomic prediction models;
- Develop a machine learning pipeline dedicated to the objectives of the project;
- Application of the pipeline to two complementary biological models, poplar and
tomato
